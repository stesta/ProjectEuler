-- | The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- | 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
-- | The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- | (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
-- | Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
-- | Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
